**Project description:**   
Improved data collection and pipeline for automation of custom breathing mask generation by using AI to detect automaticaly the landmarks of heads.
I designed a protocol to calculate the bias between a mobile and industrial 3D scanning solution to simplify the process of design.

This work leads to a publication and presentation of scientific paper for the international 3DBodytech conference in October 2022 in Switzerland.

# [Computer Vision applied to basketball game](/sample_page)

**Project description:**   
The main objectif of this project is to be able, in real time ideally, add a display for the tracking of the basketball player.
The display should show the name of the player. 
 

##The first step is the detection of the basket court
