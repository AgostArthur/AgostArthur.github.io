**Project description:**   
Improved data collection and pipeline for automation of custom breathing mask generation by using AI to detect automaticaly the landmarks of heads.
I designed a protocol to calculate the bias between a mobile and industrial 3D scanning solution to simplify the process of design.

This work leads to a publication and presentation of scientific paper for the international 3DBodytech conference in October 2022 in Switzerland.

# [Computer Vision applied to basketball game](/sample_page)

**Project description:**   
The main objectif of this project is to be able, in real time ideally, add a display for the tracking of the basketball player.
The display should show the name of the player. 
 

The first step is to detect the basketball court.
Using OpenCV and applying several filters, we can highlight the strong color variations to find the edges of the objects present in the image. 
We notice that the edges of the court are straight lines. These lines are used to detect the area of interest. Thus will be interested only in people present in this area.

The second step is the player's detection
