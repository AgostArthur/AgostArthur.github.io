Improved data collection and pipeline for automation of custom breathing mask generation by using AI to detect automaticaly the landmarks of heads.
I designed a protocol to calculate the bias between a mobile and industrial 3D scanning solution to simplify the process of design.

This work leads to a publication and presentation of scientific paper for the international 3DBodytech conference in October 2022 in Switzerland.
