**Project description:**   
The main goal of this work is to be able with a single snapshot made with a iphone to automaticaly create a customized face mask.

Improved data collection and pipeline for automation of custom breathing mask generation by using AI to detect automaticaly the landmarks of heads.
I designed a protocol to calculate the bias between a mobile and industrial 3D scanning solution to improve the process of design.

# [Real time tracking of basketball players](/sample_page)
Computer vision - OpenCV - CNN network - Python

**Project description:**   
The main objectif of this project is to be able, in real time ideally, add a display for the tracking of the basketball player.
The display should show the name of the player. 
 

The first step is to detect the basketball court.
Using OpenCV and applying several filters, we can highlight the strong color variations to find the edges of the objects present in the image. 
We notice that the edges of the court are straight lines. These lines are used to detect the area of interest. Thus will be interested only in people present in this area.

The second step is player detection. Humans are detected using the pre-trained Yolo algorithm that we combined with a classifier. The goal of this classifier is to separate all detected humans between 3 labels: Team 1, Team 2, non-player.

We then trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to track the players in the bounding box using their names.
